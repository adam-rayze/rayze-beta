      <div class="leading-relaxed mb-12">
        <p>Smart contracts represent one of the most revolutionary aspects of blockchain technology, fundamentally changing how we think about digital agreements and automation. As the foundation of modern Web3 applications and <a href="https://rayze.io/daos" class="text-[#00BF63] hover:underline">DAOs</a>, understanding smart contracts is crucial for anyone involved in the blockchain ecosystem.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">What Is a Smart Contract?</h2>
      <div class="leading-relaxed mb-12">
        <p>At its core, a smart contract is a self-executing program that lives on a blockchain. Think of it as a digital vending machine: once you input the correct conditions (like inserting the right amount of money), the machine automatically performs its end of the deal (dispensing your selected item). Similarly, smart contracts automatically execute actions when predetermined conditions are met, without requiring human intervention.</p>
        
        <p class="mt-4">This automation and trustlessness make smart contracts the perfect foundation for <a href="https://rayze.io/daos" class="text-[#00BF63] hover:underline">decentralized organizations</a> and Web3 applications.</p>
      </div>

      <hr class="border-gray-800 my-12" />

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">How Do Smart Contracts Work?</h2>
      <div class="leading-relaxed mb-12">
        <p>Smart contracts operate on a simple "if/then" principle. For example:</p>
        
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li>If Alice sends 1 ETH to Bob, then transfer ownership of Bob's digital artwork to Alice</li>
          <li>If it's the 1st of the month, then automatically transfer rent payment from tenant to landlord</li>
          <li>If the temperature sensor records below freezing, then send an insurance payout to the farmer</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-6">What makes smart contracts special is their immutable and decentralized nature. Once deployed on a blockchain:</p>

        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li>The code cannot be changed (immutability)</li>
          <li>The execution is guaranteed (no one can stop it)</li>
          <li>The process is transparent (anyone can verify the rules)</li>
          <li>The outcome is deterministic (same input always produces same output)</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <hr class="border-gray-800 my-12" />

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Real-World Applications</h2>
      <div class="leading-relaxed mb-12">
        <p>Smart contracts are revolutionizing various industries:</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Finance</h3>
        <p>They power decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, and insurance products. When you swap tokens on platforms like Uniswap, you're interacting with smart contracts that automatically calculate exchange rates and execute trades.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Supply Chain Management</h3>
        <p>Smart contracts track products from origin to destination, automatically releasing payments when goods reach specific checkpoints and meet quality standards.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4">Real Estate</h3>
        <p>They can automate rent payments, handle property transfers, and manage tenant agreements without intermediaries.</p>

        <p class="mt-6">Through platforms like <a href="https://rayze.io" class="text-[#00BF63] hover:underline">Rayze</a>, organizations can leverage smart contracts for automated treasury management, governance, and investment operations.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="text-4xl font-bold mb-8">Benefits and Limitations</h2>
      <div class="leading-relaxed mb-12">
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Key Benefits</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Automation reduces human error and eliminates intermediaries</li>
          <li>Transparency builds trust among parties</li>
          <li>Cost reduction by removing middlemen</li>
          <li>Speed and efficiency in execution</li>
          <li>Immutability ensures contract terms cannot be altered</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Limitations</h3>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
          <li>Once deployed, bugs cannot be easily fixed</li>
          <li>Complex legal agreements can be difficult to code</li>
          <li>The "code is law" nature means errors can be costly</li>
          <li>Smart contracts can't directly access real-world data without oracles</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <hr class="border-gray-800 my-12" />
